# 🌟 Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! 🎉 This project is my playground to **experiment, learn, and share my skills**. It reflects my journey as a **Computer Science Engineering student** and my professional growth as a **part-time Software Engineer**. 

## 🌐 About the Portfolio https://mirojlassi.github.io/Portfolio/

This portfolio isn't just a showcase of my work—it's a place where I continuously experiment with new features, improve my skills, and have fun! Every feature implemented is a step forward in mastering concepts like clean code, Git workflows, and innovative design.

## ✨ Features 🛠

Here’s a glimpse of the journey so far:

1. **Static Projects Showcase**  
   Initially, all my projects were hardcoded into the portfolio. Each new project required manually diving into the code to update the list.  

2. **Automation - Local Project List https://github.com/MiroJlassi/Portfolio/pull/1**  
   The first upgrade automated this process. I created a local project list that dynamically displayed all projects, making the process more efficient.  

3. **Backend Integration https://github.com/MiroJlassi/Portfolio/pull/2**  
   To further enhance automation, I built a **dedicated backend** for managing projects. With this update, I can now **add, edit, or delete projects** directly from the backend, streamlining the workflow.  

4. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle https://github.com/MiroJlassi/Portfolio/pull/5**  
   Recently, I implemented a **theme toggle**! This feature not only enhances user experience but also allowed me to explore:
   - Component communication  
   - Observables and subscriptions with a **Theme Manager Service**

5. **Git Professionalism**  
   I take pride in maintaining this project using **professional Git workflows**, including:  
   - Creating separate branches for features and bug fixes  
   - Merging and resolving conflicts efficiently  

6. **Continuous Creativity**  
   I constantly come up with random ideas and aim to implement them here, making this project a hub for learning and creativity.  

## 🛠 Future Plans

- Adding animations and micro-interactions for better user experience  
- Experimenting with new technologies and frameworks  

## 🤝 Contributions

While this is a personal project, I'm always open to feedback and suggestions! Feel free to create issues to suggest new features.
